# Aim:

You possess a portrait in classic realism. How would you prompt the AI to reproduce it as a stylized digital anime version, maintaining the character’s expression and pose?

# Algorithm: 

## 1.Input Image:

Provide the original realistic portrait.

## 2.Define Constraints:

Maintain pose, facial expression, and identity.

## 3.Prompt Construction:

Subject → "portrait of [character]"

Style → "anime, digital art, clean line art, vibrant colors"

Constraints → "same expression, same pose, retain hairstyle"

Negative → "no realism, no distortion, no extra limbs"

## 4.Iterative Refinement:

Start with a simple prompt → add style refinements → enforce constraints with negatives.

## 5.Generate Output:

Use text-to-image or image-to-image AI models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, MidJourney, DALL·E).

## 6.Compare Outputs:

Observe fidelity to pose/expression and anime stylization quality.

# Sample Prompts & Outputs

## Prompt 1 – Simple
"Anime version of this portrait, keeping the same pose and facial expression." Output → Basic anime filter applied, recognizable but generic.

## Prompt 2 – Detailed Style
"Transform this portrait into a detailed anime illustration, same pose and expression. Retain hairstyle and clothing, adapt features into anime proportions with large expressive eyes and smooth shading. Vibrant colors and glowing background." Output → Clear anime features, expression preserved, artistic improvements visible.

## Prompt 3 – Advanced with Negatives
"Recreate this realistic portrait in modern digital anime style. Keep identical pose, facial expression, hairstyle, and outfit. Use clean line art, cel-shading, soft gradients, glowing pastel background. Avoid realism, distortions, extra limbs, or changing the expression." Output → Highly stylized anime artwork, faithful to reference identity and pose, with professional finish.

# Result: 
By refining prompts step by step, the AI was successfully guided to generate an anime-styled version of the portrait, preserving expression and pose while applying stylistic elements like anime line art, expressive eyes, and vibrant shading. This exploration shows that structured prompt engineering + iterative refinement yields more controlled and consistent results.
